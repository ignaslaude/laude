[Gradfolio](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio){:target="_blank"} is a responsive, dark-mode ready Jekyll theme designed keeping academia in mind. The easiest way to install the theme is to fork it using GitHub. Check the README file for [instructions](https://github.com/jitinnair1/gradfolio#installation){:target="_blank"}.

If you want to like this theme and would like to use it for your portfolio, send me a DM so I can send you the source code for free. Don't ask me why.

The social-icons footer can be used to link profiles from GitHub, OrcID and ReasearchGate aprart form the usual Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook. You can add your user ID in the `_config.yml` file to link your accounts.

PS: If you liked the theme, do star it on GitHub!

This website serves purposely as a project archive for my unorganized ass. No intro, no narcisstic "about" section, just a slate site for once. Check out [laude.cloud](https://laude.cloud/) if you're annoyingly interested to know more about me.

Also, if you find this theme cute and would like to use it for your portfolio, send me a DM so I can send you the source code for free. Don't ask me why.

### Also, check out:

- [The slut dragons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlVlY6QAKpc) - thought you might find interesting...
